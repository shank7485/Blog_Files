Work Experience:
Tata Consultancy Services, – Integration Intern, NextGen R&D Santa Clara, California (May 2015 – August 2015)
-Deployed an OpenStack cloud infrastructure on RHEL 7 servers to leverage it as a Network Functions Virtualization Infrastructure.
-Integrated TCS developed Python based NFV Manager as per ETSI MANO specs on deployed OpenStack cloud.
-Orchestrated Project Clearwater vIMS VMs using OpenStack HEAT to demonstrate the solution as a Proof of Concept. On completion, VoIP calls could be made between two softphones present in different network subnets to one another inside an OpenStack tenant.

Academic Projects:
Cloud Media Streaming Service: Java Jersey RESTful Web services, AWS EC2, AWS S3, Android, JSON, Jetty HTTP2 Server
-Developed a REST API in Jersey REST framework which returns a JSON containing the list of media available on an AWS S3 bucket.
-Implemented an Android app which parses the JSON and displays the media list so that a user can select a media and make it play on a media player.
-Developed a REST API to provide a HTTP2 interface to a Java implementation of VLC Media Player to control the player using the android app as a remote.

Internet of Things with Raspberry Pi - Home Surveillance: Java Sockets, Python, Android, Raspberry Pi SoC
-Provided live MJPEG video stream from Raspberry Pi camera to an Android app remotely over HTTP.
-Developed an android app to view the live MJPEG video and to control door locks of a home using Java Sockets and Python scripts.
-Established a way to send alert notification to the Android app using Parse.io RESTful API whenever an activity is detected in the Pi camera.

Layer-3 Firewall app on SDN Controller using OpenFlow and Open vSwitch: Python Pyretic, Mininet
-Developed a Layer-3 firewall app on top of POX SDN controller which gets access list policies from a user though a CLI.
-Controller installs flows on vSwitch using OpenFlow based on user policies. The controller also detects DoS attacks by looking for series of ICMP packets.

Design of Flea Market Database: Oracle DB, SQL
-Designed a Flea Market database by initially analyzing the data requirements and formed the ER diagram.
-Mapped the ER diagram into 3NF normalized relations and populated it with records using SQL INSERT and UPDATE Queries.

Side Projects:
Docker container as a Service: URL - https://github.com/shank7485/Dockerized-DeepDream-with-Flask Docker Container, HTML, Python Flask
-Developed an API using Python Flask to receive image files from multiple users and process them using Google’s Deep Dream A.I. in a Docker container.
-Wrote python scripts to maintain queues and process the images in parallel using threads to prevent incoming user requests from getting blocked.

Personal Website: URL – http://www.shashankkumar.me HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), Python Flask, Amazon Web Services EC2
-Built a website in spare time to portray my skills and deployed it on an Apache mod WSGI server in an AWS EC2 instance.
-Programmed the front-end using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap) and back-end using Python Flask.
